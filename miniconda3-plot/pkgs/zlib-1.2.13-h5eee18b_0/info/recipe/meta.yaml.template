    patches:
        - cmake-pkg-config.patch
        # Both patches are needed to remediate CVE-2022-37434; the "-1" patch
        # had a bug that broke downstream packages like `curl`, which was
        # addressed in the "-2" patch. As of 2022-09-07, these patches have
        # been adopted by Debian and SUSE as fixes for the vulnerability.
        # We're following Debian's pattern and keeping these patches separate
        # (rather than consolidating them) to keep their provenance clear.
        # - CVE-2022-37434-1.patch (extremly suspicious patch ... )
        # - CVE-2022-37434-2.patch
