  # This package needs to be noarch because it uses POSIX system APIs.
  # The Windows build will be skipped when built to avoid Prefect failures.
  # There is no Windows port available and porting to Windows is not trivial.
  # However, the compiled package can be used on Windows.
  # Tzdata is utilizing system header files which is not
  # compatible with macOS.
  # Since we are using using a noarch build, we can
  # simply focus linux as our main build

  skip: True  # [not (linux and x86_64)]
